Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express - Bluetooth LE

Adafruit SGP30 Air Quality Sensor Breakout - VOC and eCO2 - Keep in mind that the version I used did not have a STEMMA QT connector. I soldered the wires directly. I don't know if there is enough room in the Diamnond Select Handheld case to accomodate. However, you could 3D print a bigger case if you wish.

Code used was example code provided by Adafruit with slight modifications by me. 

Make sure to set up an Adafruit IO account and have your "feeds" named "rx". If you want something different, make sure to match what is in the code or it won't connect.
