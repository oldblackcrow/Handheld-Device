Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express - Bluetooth LE
Adafruit SGP30 Air Quality Sensor Breakout - VOC and eCO2 - Keep in mind that the version I used did not have a STEMMA QT connector. I soldered the wires directly. I don't know if there is enough room in the Diamnond Select Handheld case to accomodate. However, you could 3D print a bigger case if you wish.
All the files you need for the Handheld device are provided above.
